# Queue Logic Fixes Summary

## 🔧 Critical Issues Fixed

### Issue #1: **Race Condition in Call Next Patient** ⚠️ **CRITICAL**

**Problem:** Multiple users could be notified it's their turn simultaneously due to duplicate `call_next_patient` implementations.

**Root Cause:** 
- Two separate implementations existed:
  1. REST API in `Backend/routers/queue.py` (line 146)
  2. WebSocket handler in `Backend/routers/websocket.py` (line 273)
- No synchronization between them, leading to race conditions

**Fix Applied:**
- ✅ Created atomic `_call_next_patient_atomic()` function with `asyncio.Lock()` 
- ✅ Unified all call-next logic to use this single, thread-safe function
- ✅ Both REST API and WebSocket now use the same atomic implementation
- ✅ Added proper error handling and logging

**Files Modified:**
- `Backend/routers/queue.py` - Added atomic function with locking
- `Backend/routers/websocket.py` - Updated to use atomic function

### Issue #2: **Incorrect Auto-Completion Logic** ⚠️ **CRITICAL**

**Problem:** Both patients showing "consultation terminée" instead of proper consultation flow.

**Root Cause:**
- Aggressive auto-completion logic that marked ALL consulting tickets as completed when queue became empty
- This interfered with the natural consultation flow where patients should stay in "consulting" status until manually completed

**Expected Flow:**
1. Person A joins → WAITING, position 1
2. Person B joins → WAITING, position 2  
3. Admin calls next → Person A: CONSULTING ("consultation en cours"), Person B: position 1 WAITING ("C'est votre tour!")
4. Admin calls next → Person B: CONSULTING ("consultation en cours"), Person A: still CONSULTING
5. Admin manually completes → Status changes to COMPLETED

**Fix Applied:**
- ✅ **Removed aggressive auto-completion logic** from `_call_next_patient_atomic()`
- ✅ **Removed auto-completion in ticket status check** 
- ✅ Tickets now remain in CONSULTING status until manually completed by admin
- ✅ Proper status flow: WAITING → CONSULTING → (manual completion) → COMPLETED

**Files Modified:**
- `Backend/routers/queue.py` - Lines 70-90 and 230-250

### Issue #3: **Inconsistent Queue Position Calculation** ⚠️ **HIGH**

**Problem:** Complex and buggy position calculation logic in ticket creation.

**Root Cause:**
```python
# Old buggy logic in Backend/routers/tickets.py
for ticket in waiting_tickets:
    if ticket.priority.value == priority.value:
        position = len([t for t in waiting_tickets if t.priority.value >= priority.value]) + 1
        # Multiple list comprehensions, inconsistent with queue ordering
```

**Fix Applied:**
- ✅ Simplified position calculation logic 
- ✅ Made it consistent with queue ordering (`priority.desc(), created_at.asc()`)
- ✅ Removed performance-heavy list comprehensions

**Files Modified:**
- `Backend/routers/tickets.py` - Lines 45-80

### Issue #4: **Service Waiting Count Inconsistencies** ⚠️ **HIGH**

**Problem:** Multiple places manually updating `current_waiting` count, leading to inconsistencies.

**Root Cause:**
- Manual updates in multiple files without coordination
- No validation that count matches actual waiting tickets
- Race conditions between different update mechanisms

**Fix Applied:**
- ✅ Created `_update_queue_positions_after_change()` function
- ✅ Centralized all queue position and waiting count updates
- ✅ Automatic count validation: `service.current_waiting = len(waiting_tickets)`
- ✅ Removed manual count updates to prevent conflicts

**Files Modified:**
- `Backend/routers/tickets.py` - Added centralized update function
- `Backend/routers/tickets_enhanced.py` - Removed manual updates
- `Backend/routers/queue.py` - Integrated with centralized updates

### Issue #5: **Missing Queue Position Updates** ⚠️ **MEDIUM**

**Problem:** When tickets were created/updated/cancelled, other patients' positions weren't recalculated.

**Root Cause:**
- Position updates only happened during `call_next_patient`
- New tickets didn't trigger position recalculation for existing waiters
- Cancelled tickets left gaps in position numbers

**Fix Applied:**
- ✅ Added automatic queue position updates after every change
- ✅ Real-time WebSocket notifications for position changes
- ✅ Consistent position numbering (1, 2, 3, ... no gaps)

**Functions Updated:**
- `create_ticket()` - Now updates all positions after creation
- `update_ticket_status()` - Updates positions when status/priority changes  
- `cancel_ticket()` - Recalculates positions after cancellation
- `join_queue_online()` - Updates positions after online join
- `scan_to_join_queue()` - Updates positions after QR join

## 🔒 Key Technical Solutions

### 1. **Atomic Locking Mechanism**
```python
# Lock to prevent race conditions when calling next patient
_call_next_lock = asyncio.Lock()

async def _call_next_patient_atomic(service_id: int, db: Session, admin_user: User = None):
    async with _call_next_lock:
        # All call_next_patient logic here - guaranteed atomic
```

### 2. **Proper Consultation Flow**
```python
# REMOVED: Aggressive auto-completion
# OLD CODE that caused issues:
# if len(remaining_tickets) == 0:
#     # Mark all consulting tickets as completed  ❌ WRONG!

# NEW CODE: Natural flow
# Tickets stay in CONSULTING until manually completed ✅ CORRECT!
auto_completed = False  # No automatic completion
```

### 3. **Centralized Queue Management**
```python
async def _update_queue_positions_after_change(service_id: int, db: Session):
    # Get all waiting tickets in proper order
    waiting_tickets = db.query(Ticket).filter(...).order_by(
        Ticket.priority.desc(), Ticket.created_at.asc()
    ).all()
    
    # Update positions and waiting count atomically
    for i, ticket in enumerate(waiting_tickets, 1):
        ticket.position_in_queue = i
        ticket.estimated_wait_time = (i - 1) * avg_time_per_patient
    
    # Ensure service count matches reality
    service.current_waiting = len(waiting_tickets)
    
    # Send real-time updates
    await connection_manager.queue_position_update(...)
```

### 4. **Consistent Ordering Logic**
- **Priority-based ordering**: Higher priority goes first
- **Time-based tie-breaking**: Within same priority, first-come-first-served
- **SQL ordering**: `ORDER BY priority DESC, created_at ASC`

## 🎯 Correct User Experience Flow

### Frontend Display Logic (Already Working):
- **Position 1 + WAITING** → Shows **"C'est votre tour!"** (go to secretary)
- **CONSULTING status** → Shows **"Votre consultation est en cours"** (consultation in progress)  
- **COMPLETED status** → Shows **"Votre consultation est terminée"** (consultation finished)

### Backend Status Transitions:
1. **Join Queue** → Status: `WAITING`, Position: calculated
2. **Admin calls next** → Status: `CONSULTING`, Position: removed from queue
3. **Admin completes** → Status: `COMPLETED` (manual action required)

## 🧪 Testing

The fix ensures the correct flow:
1. ✅ Person A joins queue → WAITING
2. ✅ Person B joins queue → WAITING  
3. ✅ Admin calls next → Person A: CONSULTING, Person B: position 1 WAITING ("C'est votre tour!")
4. ✅ Admin calls next → Person B: CONSULTING, Person A: still CONSULTING
5. ✅ No automatic completion interference

## 📈 Performance Improvements

1. **Reduced Database Queries**: Centralized position updates
2. **Eliminated List Comprehensions**: Simplified position calculation  
3. **Atomic Operations**: Fewer database round-trips
4. **Consistent State**: No more data inconsistencies requiring fixes
5. **Removed Unnecessary Auto-completion**: Cleaner, more predictable flow
