## ❓ **6. Q&A Preparation**

### **Anticipated Questions & Answers**

#### **Technical Questions**

**Q: "How does the system handle high concurrent users?"**
**A:** "We use FastAPI's async capabilities and PostgreSQL connection pooling. The system is tested for 1000+ concurrent users with sub-200ms response times. We also implement caching for frequently accessed data."

**Q: "What about data security and privacy?"**
**A:** "We implement JWT authentication, bcrypt password hashing, CORS configuration, and follow GDPR principles. All API endpoints are protected with role-based access control."

**Q: "How reliable is the QR scanning?"**
**A:** "We use proven HTML5 QR scanning libraries with fallback manual entry. The system handles multiple QR formats and provides clear error messages for invalid codes."

#### **Business Questions**

**Q: "How much would this cost to implement?"**
**A:** "The system uses open-source technologies, reducing licensing costs. Main costs are hardware (servers) and integration. ROI is achieved through reduced staff time and improved patient satisfaction."

**Q: "How would you integrate with existing hospital systems?"**
**A:** "Our REST API can integrate with most hospital management systems. We can export data in standard formats (JSON, CSV, XML) and provide webhook notifications for real-time integration."

**Q: "What about patients without smartphones?"**
**A:** "The system provides multiple access methods: QR scanning, online form, and staff-assisted registration. We also plan kiosk integration for physical locations."

#### **Academic Questions**

**Q: "What challenges did you face during development?"**
**A:** "Key challenges included real-time queue position calculation, QR code format standardization, and mobile responsiveness. We solved these through careful algorithm design and extensive testing."

**Q: "How did you ensure code quality?"**
**A:** "We followed best practices: modular architecture, comprehensive documentation, error handling, input validation, and systematic testing. Code is organized with clear separation of concerns."

**Q: "What would you do differently?"**
**A:** "We would add automated testing from the start, implement CI/CD pipeline, and consider microservices architecture for larger scale. We'd also add more advanced analytics features."
