# Services Page Fix Summary

## Problem
The services page was showing "Erreur: Erreur lors du chargement des services" even though the backend was returning 200 OK.

## Root Cause
1. **Missing WebSocket Client**: The `websocket-client.js` script was not included in `services.html`
2. **Missing Null Checks**: The code tried to use `wsClient` without checking if it was loaded
3. **Missing Function Exports**: `callNextPatient` and `viewQueue` functions were not exposed globally

## Fixes Applied

### 1. Added WebSocket Client Script
```html
<script src="../shared/websocket-client.js"></script>
```

### 2. Added Null Checks for WebSocket Client
```javascript
// Check if wsClient is available
if (typeof wsClient === 'undefined' || !wsClient) {
    console.warn('WebSocket client not available, skipping WebSocket initialization');
    return;
}
```

### 3. Wrapped WebSocket Initialization in Try-Catch
```javascript
try {
    initializeWebSockets();
} catch (wsError) {
    console.error('WebSocket initialization error:', wsError);
    // Don't let WebSocket errors break the page
}
```

### 4. Exposed Missing Functions
```javascript
window.callNextPatient = callNextPatient;
window.viewQueue = viewQueue;
```

### 5. Added Debug Logging
Added console.log statements to help debug future issues:
- Loading services...
- Services data received: [data]

## Result
The services page should now load correctly without errors. The WebSocket functionality will work if available, but won't break the page if there are connection issues.

## Testing
1. Refresh the services page
2. Check browser console for any errors
3. Services should display correctly
4. Call Next and View Queue buttons should work
5. Real-time updates will work if WebSocket connects successfully
